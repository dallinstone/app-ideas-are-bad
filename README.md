A simple app created in React, TypeScript, and `react-bootstrap` for developers to let others know what they think of their app ideas.

"I have an idea for an app. Will you help me build it? 50/50 on profits."

"It's the next Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/Reddit!"

Mostly made as a demo to show that I can, in fact, make and publish a React app to the cloud. 

The site is hosted in Google Cloud Platform on an App Engine service. Domain was purchased from Google Domains. SSL certificates were also provided by Google.
